# Anime Studio Library

**Stylized as:** `Anime Studio LIBrary` (a common practice with my software documentation, as a subliminal way of teaching people that `lib` stands for `Library`)

The Anime Studio Library is a media library of usable Anime and Manga media that can be used in your project. It is written in C, Gosu, and Raku.
